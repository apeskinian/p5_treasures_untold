‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

In this section, include a few paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Essentially, this part is your "sales pitch". Describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target, and how it will be useful to the target audience.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

üõë NOTES üõë

Do not add a **Table of Contents** to your Markdown files. GitHub has these built-in automatically using the headers/hashtags.

Don't add screenshots for the README/TESTING into your `assets` or `static` folders. Create a new folder at the root-level called `documentation`. Consider creating sub-directories within `documentation` to handle things like `wireframes`, `features`, `validation`, `responsiveness`, etc.

**Site Mockups**
*([amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://apeskinian-treasures-untold-568a3e176ede.herokuapp.com), [techsini](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup), etc.)*
Having issues generating site mockups? This is likely due to security policies with your deployed site.
If you open up your DevTools, there may be an error referencing `X-Frame-Options`.

For Chrome users, head over to http://bit.ly/3iRPn4u and install the extension within your browser. Once installed, navigate back to the mockup site of your choice. You should find your site rendering in the various devices now.

Alternatively, open your project in Gitpod and run the server. Once the site is running, click the `Ports` tab from your Gitpod Terminal. Click the padlock on the appropriate port for your project (`Flask: 5000`, `Django: 8000`). This will make your local page public temporarily. Now, copy the URL of your live-preview page into the responsive tool above. You should find your site rendering in the various devices.

### Colour Scheme

‚ö†Ô∏èINSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Explain your colors and color scheme. Consider adding a link and screenshot for your color scheme using [coolors](https://coolors.co/generate).

When you add a color to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your color palette later if needed. See example below:

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/080708-3772ff-df2935-fdca40-e6e8e6) to generate my color palette.

- `#000000` primary text.
- `#3772FF` primary highlights.
- `#DF2935` secondary text.
- `#FDCA40` secondary highlights.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

### Typography

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like **Google Fonts**, **Font Awesome**, etc. Consider adding a link to each font used, the Font Awesome site (if used), or similar icon library.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.
- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Database Design

### Data Model

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models. Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

![screenshot](documentation/erd.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Using your defined models, create an ERD with the relationships identified. A couple of recommendations for building your own free ERDs:
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning)
- [Draw.io](https://draw.io)

Looking for an interactive version of your ERD? Consider using a [`Mermaid flowchart`](https://mermaid.live). To simplify the process, you can ask ChatGPT (or similar) the following prompt:

> ChatGPT Prompt:
> "Generate a Markdown syntax Mermaid ERD using my Django models"
> [paste-your-django-models-into-ChatGPT]

The "Boutique Ado" sample ERD in Markdown syntax using Mermaid can be seen below as an example.

**NOTE**: A Markdown Preview tool doesn't show the interactive ERD; you must first commit/push the code to your GitHub repository in order to see it live in action.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

I have used `Mermaid` to generate an interactive ERD of my project.

‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED ‚ö†Ô∏è

Alternatively, or in addition to, a more comprehensive ERD can be auto-generated once you're at the end of your development stages, just before you submit. Follow the steps below to obtain a thorough ERD that you can include. Feel free to leave the steps below in the README for future use to yourself.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

I have used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- drag the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

‚ö†Ô∏è TIP ‚ö†Ô∏è

Consider adding screenshots of your Projects Board(s), Issues (open and closed), and Milestone tasks.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END ---‚ö†Ô∏è

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/apeskinian/p5_treasures_untold/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/apeskinian/p5_treasures_untold/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

| Link | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/apeskinian/p5_treasures_untold)](https://www.github.com/apeskinian/p5_treasures_untold/issues) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-open.png) |
| [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/apeskinian/p5_treasures_untold)](https://www.github.com/apeskinian/p5_treasures_untold/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png) |

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCow" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

## Ecommerce Business Model

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to discuss the business model for your e-commerce project. An example is provided below that aligns closely with **Boutique Ado's B2C** strategy. Be sure to align to your own project requirements.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

This site sells goods to individual customers, and therefore follows a **Business to Customer** model. It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers, especially when using larger platforms such a Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users. For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock, updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## SEO & Marketing

### Keywords

I've identified some appropriate keywords to align with my site, that should help users when searching online to find my page easily from a search engine. This included a series of the following keyword types:

- Short-tail (head terms) keywords
- Long-tail keywords

I've also played around with [Word Tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com) a bit to check the frequency of some of my site's primary keywords (only until the free trial expired).

### Sitemap

I've used [XML-Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com) to generate a sitemap.xml file. This was generated using my deployed site URL: https://apeskinian-treasures-untold-568a3e176ede.herokuapp.com

After it finished crawling the entire site, it created a [sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml), which I've downloaded and included in the repository.

### Robots

I've created the [robots.txt](robots.txt) file at the root-level. Inside, I've included the default settings:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://apeskinian-treasures-untold-568a3e176ede.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

Further links for future implementation:

- [Managing your sitemaps and using sitemaps reports](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451001)
- [Testing the robots.txt file](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598)

### Social Media Marketing

Creating a strong social base (with participation) and linking that to the business site can help drive sales. Using more popular providers with a wider user base, such as Facebook, typically maximizes site views.

I've created a mockup Facebook business account using the [Balsamiq template](https://code-institute-org.github.io/5P-Assessments-Handbook/files/Facebook_Mockups.zip) provided by Code Institute.

![screenshot](documentation/mockup-facebook.png)

### Newsletter Marketing

I have incorporated a newsletter sign-up form on my application, to allow users to supply their email address if they are interested in learning more. 

‚ö†Ô∏è OPTION 1: RECOMMENDED ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Custom Django Model Newsletter**

- Create a custom `newsletter` app in your project, with a custom model/class called `Newsletter`.
- This method satisfies two assessment criteria:
    1. include a newsletter
    2. one of your 3 required custom models
- It doesn't need anything except the `email` field on the model, but feel free to add more if you need.
- Example: (keep this in your README if you've done this method, attach your `Newsletter` model in a code block like the following example)
    ```python
    class Newsletter(models.Model):
        email = models.EmailField(null=False, blank=False)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.email
    ```
- Consider using the same `send_mail()` functionality used on the `webhook_handler.py` file.
    - You can trigger an email to be sent out to subscribed users when new products are added to the site!

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

üõë OPTION 2 üõë

**MailChimp Newsletter**

- Sign up for a Mailchimp account
- This allows up to 2,500 subscription email sends per month
- Incorporate the code and scripts into your project like in the Code Institute lessons.

üõë --- END --- üõë

## Testing

> [!NOTE]
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://apeskinian-treasures-untold-568a3e176ede.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then finally, click **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables to match your private `env.py` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

üõë !!! ATTENTION apeskinian !!! üõë

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT update the environment variables to your own! These should never be public; only use the demo values below! ‚ö†Ô∏è

üõë --- END --- üõë

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user-inserts-own-aws-access-key-id |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user-inserts-own-aws-secret-access-key |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user-inserts-own-gmail-api-key |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user-inserts-own-gmail-email-address |
| `SECRET_KEY` | any-random-secret-key |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user-inserts-own-stripe-public-key |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user-inserts-own-stripe-secret-key |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user-inserts-own-stripe-webhook-secret |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)

You can install this project's **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** (*where applicable*) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **[Procfile](Procfile)** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where `settings.py` is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either (*recommended*):

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (*replace `app_name` with your app name*)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For "Primary Interest", you can choose **Programmable Media for image and video API**.
- *Optional*: edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the leading `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.
    - `cloudinary://123456789012345:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStuVwXyZa@1a2b3c4d5)`
- This will go into your own `env.py` file, and Heroku Config Vars, using the **key** of `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

### PostgreSQL

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net) for the Relational Database with Django.

> [!CAUTION]
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Submitted my email address to the CI PostgreSQL Database link above.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.
- The Database connection string will resemble something like this:
    - `postgres://<db_username>:<db_password>@<db_host_url>/<db_name>`
- You can use the above URL with Django; simply paste it into your `env.py` file and Heroku Config Vars as `DATABASE_URL`.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://apeskinian-treasures-untold-568a3e176ede.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (*verify your password and account*)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords** (*search for it at the top, if not*).
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
    - Any custom name, such as "Django" or `p5_treasures_untold`
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
    - Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
    - If your 16-character password contains *spaces*, make sure to remove them entirely.
    - `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
    - `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### WhiteNoise

This project uses the [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to aid with static files temporarily hosted on the live Heroku site.

To include WhiteNoise in your own projects:

- Install the latest WhiteNoise package:
    - `pip install whitenoise`
- Update the `requirements.txt` file with the newly installed package:
    - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Edit your `settings.py` file and add WhiteNoise to the `MIDDLEWARE` list, above all other middleware (apart from Django‚Äôs "SecurityMiddleware"):

```python
# settings.py

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    # any additional middleware
]
```


### Local Development

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level, and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

üõë !!! ATTENTION apeskinian !!! üõë

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT update the environment variables to your own! These should never be public; only use the demo values below! ‚ö†Ô∏è

üõë --- END --- üõë

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user-inserts-own-aws-access-key-id")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user-inserts-own-aws-secret-access-key")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user-inserts-own-gmail-host-api-key")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user-inserts-own-gmail-email-address")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any-random-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-public-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user-inserts-own-stripe-webhook-secret")  # only if using Stripe Webhooks

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` (*Windows/Linux*) or `‚åò+C` (*Mac*)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` then `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate --plan` then `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (*if applicable*): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (*repeat for each file*)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
- **NOTE**: You should never make a backup of the default *admin* or *users* data with confidential information.

### Local VS Deployment

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to discuss any differences between the local version you've developed, and the live deployment site. Generally, there shouldn't be [m]any major differences, so if you honestly cannot find any differences, feel free to use the following example:

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END --- ‚ö†Ô∏è

There are no remaining major differences between the local version when compared to the deployed version online.

## Credits

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

In the following sections, you need to reference where you got your content, media, and any extra help. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials (which is totally acceptable), however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid potential plagiarism.

‚ö†Ô∏è --- END ---‚ö†Ô∏è

### Content

‚ö†Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use this space to provide attribution links for any borrowed code snippets, elements, and resources. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every resource used, not just a generic link to the main site. If you've used multiple components from the same source (such as Bootstrap), then you only need to list it once, but if it's multiple Codepen samples, then you should list each example individually. If you've used AI for some assistance (such as ChatGPT or Perplexity), be sure to mention that as well. A few examples have been provided below to give you some ideas.

If you're the owner (or a close acquaintance) of some/all media files, then make sure to specify this information. Let the assessors know that you have explicit rights to use the media files within your project. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every media file used, not just a generic link to the main site, unless it's AI-generated artwork.

Looking for some media files? Here are some popular sites to use. The list of examples below is by no means exhaustive. Within the Code Institute Slack community, you can find more "free media" links by sending yourself (or Slackbot) the following command: `!freemedia`.
