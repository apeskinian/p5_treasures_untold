## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

#### Page Templates

> The main template and also other partial html files listed below were tested as part of the main site files as they include them.
> - base.html
> - toast_error.html
> - toast_info.html
> - toast_rewards.html
> - toast_success.html
> - toast_warning.html
> - info_section.html
> - login_options.html
> - mobile_navbar.html
> - standard_navbar.html

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

> [!NOTE]
> I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework along with coverage to test the application functionality.

To install the coverage, I ran the following commands:

- `pip3 install coverage`
- `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`

I then created a .coveragerc file and included the following to omit files from  the report:

```text
[report]
omit =
    */migrations/*
    */tests/*
    manage.py
    __init__.py
    settings.py
```

To run the tests and get the report I ran the following commands:

- `coverage run manage.py test`
- `coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

- `coverage html`

I could then click on the link in the terminal to open the report.

Below are the results from the full coverage report on my application that I've tested:

#### Unit Test Issues

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your Python unit tests. Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known). This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues. Remove this sub-section entirely if you somehow didn't run into any issues while working with your tests.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

## Bugs

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Nobody likes bugs,... except the assessors! Projects seem more suspicious if a student doesn't properly track their bugs. If you're about to submit your project without any bugs listed below, you should ask yourself why you're doing this course in the first place, if you're able to build this entire application without running into any bugs. The best thing you can do for any project is to document your bugs! Not only does it show the true stages of development, but think of it as breadcrumbs for yourself in the future, should you encounter the same/similar bug again, it acts as a gentle reminder on what you did to fix the bug.

If/when you encounter bugs during the development stages of your project, you should document them here, ideally with a screenshot explaining what the issue was, and what you did to fix the bug.

Alternatively, an improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **[Issues](https://www.github.com/apeskinian/p5_treasures_untold/issues)** tracker on your GitHub repository. This can be found at the top of your repository, the tab called "Issues".

If using the Issues tracker for bug management, you can simplify the documentation process for testing. Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue page without having to first save the screenshot locally. You can add labels to your issues (e.g. `bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s). Once you've solved the issue/bug, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following examples below.

### Fixed Bugs

[![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search?query=repo%3Aapeskinian%2Fp5_treasures_untold%20label%3Abug&label=bugs)](https://www.github.com/apeskinian/p5_treasures_untold/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug)

I've used [GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/apeskinian/p5_treasures_untold/issues) to track and manage bugs and issues during the development stages of my project.

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/apeskinian/p5_treasures_untold/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).

### Unfixed Bugs

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

You will need to mention any unfixed bugs and why they are not fixed upon submission of your project. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. Where possible, you must fix all outstanding bugs, unless outside of your control.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here! It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue, they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

### Known Issues

| Issue | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have horizontal `overflow-x` scrolling. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/overflow.png) |
| When validating HTML with a semantic `<section>` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/section-header.png) |
| Validation errors on "signup.html" coming from the Django Allauth package. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/allauth.png) |
| With a known order-number, users can brute-force "checkout_success.html" and see potentially sensitive information. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/checkout-success.png) |
| If a product is in your bag/cart, but then gets deleted from the database, it throws errors from the session storage memory. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/session-storage.png) |
| The `-`/`+` quantity buttons work well on "product_details.html", but not on "bag.html". | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/quantity-buttons.png) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.
